# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Added a Notion learning loop: `build` now writes a local lesson-candidate
  record to `reports/lessons/` on failure instead of failing silently, and
  a new `log-lesson` subcommand records manual entries (e.g. QA feedback).
  Records mirror the real Lessons Learned Notion database schema
  field-for-field but are never written to Notion automatically -- a human
  applies them using the mapping table in README.md. CLI restructured
  into `build`/`log-lesson` subcommands.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: build a Slides deck and Docs worksheet from an
  approved template pair and a lesson content YAML, via Drive
  `files.copy` plus Slides/Docs `batchUpdate` `replaceAllText`.
