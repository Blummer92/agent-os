# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Worksheet revision QA (#2890): `worksheet_revision_qa.py` binds required
  visual roles across revisions so a vocabulary/content/layout fix cannot
  silently drop visual scaffolds and still pass as complete; render evidence
  with zero/missing required icons fails via the existing visual-completeness
  contract. `worksheet_layout_qa.py` flags large blank regions as accidental
  dead space only when expected content/response/visual roles are missing on
  the same page, routing intentional whitespace to manual review. The student
  PDF preview renderer now rejects internal review/workflow language
  (`PDF DRAFT`, `review before Google Drive`, production-authorization,
  routing, backend-handoff phrasing) from student-facing copy unless
  explicitly declared student copy, and provenance moved from a rendered
  footer paragraph into the PDF document properties.

## 0.2.0

- Added a Notion learning loop: `build` now writes a local lesson-candidate
  record to `reports/lessons/` on failure instead of failing silently, and
  a new `log-lesson` subcommand records manual entries (e.g. QA feedback).
  Records mirror the real Lessons Learned Notion database schema
  field-for-field but are never written to Notion automatically -- a human
  applies them using the mapping table in README.md. CLI restructured
  into `build`/`log-lesson` subcommands.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: build a Slides deck and Docs worksheet from an
  approved template pair and a lesson content YAML, via Drive
  `files.copy` plus Slides/Docs `batchUpdate` `replaceAllText`.
